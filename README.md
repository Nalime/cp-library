# cp-library

## Note

Currently all new commits are in a private repository.
I plan to sort out stuffs and update this repo,
but I don't have a definite ETA :/ (sorry)

## Warning

Correctness isn't guaranteed.
(Though I may add tests to guarantee some confidence of correctness later on)

Update: graph/bcc.cpp is actually 2ECC, not BCC
